Brief Introduction to problem: The objective of this application is to ensure customers have the ability to maximise the benefits reaped from the wide range of services Macquarie bank has on offer. Currently, customers are limited with the way their transaction data is analysed and displayed and there is no existing platform that personnalises available schemes and tips. To ensure MQ banking services align with customer wants and they are thus able to maximise savings/minimise expenditure, Bankquire have developed algorithms that will prove to enhance MQ services .
